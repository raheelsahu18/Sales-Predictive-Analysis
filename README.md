# Sales Predictive Analysis

This project focuses on building a predictive model for sales forecasting using historical sales data. The goal is to help businesses better understand future sales trends and make informed decisions. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Key Features:

Data Collection: Aggregation of historical sales data from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling data for better model performance.
Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features such as time-based features, promotions, holidays, and sales trends.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict future sales.
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are used to evaluate the performance of the models.
Visualization: Plotting sales trends and predictive model results for better insights.
## Technologies Used:

Python: For data manipulation and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: For data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and model results.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and modeling.
